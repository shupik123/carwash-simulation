# Car Wash Simulation

A program in Java to simulate and report the wait times of a car washâ€™s business with standard and upgraded equipment.  
Created for the [Project #2 Car Wash Simulation](https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs210/projects/Queues/CarWashProgram.html) at [Kalamazoo College](https://www.kzoo.edu/).

## Objectives

- Simulate days of business at both 3 and 4 minutes per wash.
- Track how long cars have been waiting for their wash.
- Track how many cars have been waiting longer than 10 minutes.
- Report these data for both base equipment (4 min/wash) and upgraded equipment (3 min/wash).

## Assumptions

- Events, such as car arrivals and washing, happen every minute.
- The car wash is open for 10 hours / 600 minutes.
- Every minute, cars have a 1 in 4 chance of arriving at the car wash.
- The simulation will not end until cars waiting in line are washed, but cars cannot arrive after closing.

## Results

An `output.csv` as a table created by the `CarWashApplication` main method:
